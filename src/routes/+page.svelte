		<h2 id="talk-analysis">Talk Analysis</h2>
		<h3 id="talk-1">Talk 1</h3>
		<p>
			The first talk has the speaker talking about the value of communicating with a wide
			variety of people, no matter if the share your view points. In fact, the speaker
			encourages talking to people who share very different opinions than as this will
			allow you develop your own ideas and ideologies. They also emphasize the importance
			of speaking with the intent to listen and not the intent to win an argument.
		</p>
		<h3 id="talk-2">Talk 2</h3>
		<p>
			The second talk goes about how reflection* can be the key factor that can improve
			your career. The speaker states that building the habit of reflecting on ones
			actions with the intent to improve one’s self is incredibly powerful. To strengthen
			their point, the speaker draws comparisons to professional sports teams and how they
			reflect on their games after they are finished to learn from them.
		</p>
		<h3 id="talk-3">Talk 3</h3>
		<p>
			The third talk focuses on how to use your time more effectively by setting strict
			priorities. The speaker criticizes trying to squeeze out more time out of a day
			becoming exceedingly effective at doing chores and instead mention how even very
			busy people can find time if they have a strong enough reason to do so. At the end
			of the talk they mention writing a letter to yourself about what will happened in
			the next year assuming that the next year was a great success and then setting
			priorities in order to get to the situation described in the letter. They also
			reiterates the importance of not only focusing on careers* goals but also on <strong
				>personal</strong
			>
			and
			<strong>relationship</strong> goals.
		</p>
		<h3 id="talk-4">Talk 4</h3>
		<p>
			The fourth talk discusses the fact that there is more to life than simply being
			happy. The speaker emphasizes the importance of meaning* in one’s life. According to
			the speaker there are four core pillars to meaning; belonging*, <strong
				>purpose</strong
			>,
			<strong>transcendence</strong>, and <strong>story telling</strong>. Then they talk
			about the fact that people who are grounded by these pillars are able to fact tough
			life situations head on.
		</p>
		<h3 id="talk-5">Talk 5</h3>
		<p>
			The fifth talk is about how a person’s story can affect the way they perceive their
			own life and the situations around them. They encourages critically thinking about
			your own stories and the stories of other people and considering the other side of
			those stories, the other person or opinion that is not included in that story.
		</p>
		<h3 id="how-the-information-was-presented">How the information was presented</h3>
		<p>
			The trough line of all the talks was that every speaker seemed to have a strong
			desire to either improve themselves or to show other people how to improve
			themselves. The speakers usually had a critical but caring attitude when addressing
			the status queue. They realize that it is not easy to change but that various
			changes are needed to improve one’s self and society at large.
		</p>
		<h3 id="personal-takeaway">Personal Takeaway</h3>
		<p>
			Personally, I largely agree with the points the speakers made. The main point I will
			take away are is from talk three about active prioritization. I think I can do quite
			a bit more without a massive investment setting clear goals for the future and then
			spending 30 minutes a week planning out how to spend the next week in a way to get
			closer to those goals. In summary I quite enjoyed the talks :)
