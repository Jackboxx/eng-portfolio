<h3 id="summary-and-comment">Summary and Comment</h3>
<p>
	This episode discusses the struggle that has recently appeared within the book world,
	the struggle between libraries and publishers that was created by the popularity of
	E-Books. At first E-Books were treated like regular books by copyright law meaning a
	library could only lend one at a time and the library could only lend an E-Book a
	limited amount of time. But due to the increased ease of obtaining an E-Book publishers
	felt threatened and started to implement measures to prevent libraries from buying newly
	released E-Books. Further more, publishers also increased the price of their E-Book
	licenses and gave these licenses an expiration date.

<p>
	I believe I will be saying this more then once but I think that this episode fails to
	address the root cause of the issues at hand. The episode is focused on how E-Books
	disrupted the balance of the book industry however it does not speak about the
	environment that allowed this problem to arise in the first place. The fact is that the
	goal of a library is to provide accessible knowledge to the common person but in
	contrast a publishers goal is to make money from an authors book. Notably, these goals
	are in conflict. If we lived in a world where knowledge was freely accessible to all
	publishers would not make money. Publishers fundamentally exist as a middle man between
	the author and the reader and the only reason this middle man is needed is because
	authors can’t financially support themselves otherwise. If we did not lived in a system
	that willingly or not mass produces starving artists but instead a system that supported
	the growth of creatives simply because their work is essential to a health human society
	we would not be having this issue. “Dare to dream of a flawed utopia”.

	This episodes covers the story of a town in the USA called Wilson that created their own
	fiber optic network. The town around 30,000 people didn’t receive quality internet from
	any private internet providers even after asking these providers to improve their
	infrastructure. So the town decided to create their own network and as soon as they
	started to be successful in this endeavor large telecom companies started lobbying at a
	state level to prevent city governments from being allowed to create local fiber
	networks. After a while the telecom companies succeeded but the town of Wilson was
	allowed to maintain their network as long as they didn’t expand it.

	This episode was quite well written but again I feel like their is a critical aspect
	that should be present but is not. The situation is a text book indictment of modern
	capitalism. A small local city government wants to improve their peoples lives but as
	soon as they step on a large companies foot they are legally hounded until they stop. It
	should be obvious to anyone that a necessity like an internet connection should not be
	in the hands of the private sector and anyone who claims that giving something like the
	internet to the private sector will make it more efficient is directly proven wrong by
	this story. As the episode mentioned, the town Wilson managed to keep their internet and
	was described by the speaker as an oasis, a place with faster and cheaper internet than
	any telecom company was willing to provide. However, the reason why telecom companies
	did not provide internet infrastructure of the same quality as the town is not because
	they were not capable of doing so but because it would not have been profitable for
	them. The profit margin and the private sector kill innovation and reduce peoples well
	being. Further more, the internet itself would never have been created by any private
	company as building the necessary infrastructure would not have been profitable for
	decades (that is why it was only possible for the internet to come about due to research
	projects and military funding). The private sector only leeched off of the internet once
	they could extract a profit from it.

	This episode covers an over 1 year long strike by a group of coal miners that were
	striking against their employer for better wages. More over, this episode speaks about
	how the miners could continue going on strike for such a long period of time. Mainly
	through the their strong motivation to improve their conditions and founds from unions.
	Lastly, the episode ends with mentioning that despite the strike the company has not
	been effected financially.

<p>
	I think this episode was a decent mix between coverage of a news story and a summary of
	the global events that led to this strike happening. The section speaking to an on the
	ground protester was interesting to see how they act and what they believe in. In
	addition, the emphasis on unions to help people that are on strike was nice to see.
	Sadly, the number of unions in the US has been declining and with it workers leverage
	has also decreased so any mention of unions that could compel the public to start
	fighting for more unions is great.

	This episode covered the day care market in the US and the market failure that is
	currently facing that sector of the economy. The speakers discuss how parents are
	struggling to find open day care positions and day cares don’t have enough money to
	afford enough workers to provide quality care to children. Afterwards, the speakers talk
	to an economist that explains that the concept of loans has been considered to allow
	lower income families to afford day care for their children.

	This episode did a good job of outlining the issues it discussed and unlike the other
	episodes I have seen the speakers actively criticized the fact that the US has so little
	maternity and paternity leave that economists are considering child care loans to fix
	the problem. Further more, the speakers consider these proposals as something that could
	improve the current situation while still referencing other countries and systems that
	have more sustainable systems in place. Lastly, they spoke well about the importance of
	excellent child care in increasing long term economic growth.

<h3 id="summary-and-comment-4">Summary and Comment</h3>
<p>
	This episode is about the collapse and rescue of SVB (Silicon Valley Bank). The speakers
	talk about the inherit instability of the banking system and the nature of bank runs.
	Following that, they speak about the unique situation that SVB was in due to the banks
	primary customers being Silicon Valley startups. They elaborate that this is a unique
	situation because both the bank and the startups both would suffer if interest rates
	were to increase which ended up happening.

<p>
	I think this episode does a good job simplifying a complex situation and focusing on the
	core parts. The topic of banks and more specifically bank runs can be quite complex and
	hard to grasp but the speakers did a good job outlining what was important without going
	into unnecessary detail. Further more, I really like how they described a central
	problem of banking, the fact that banks the way we know them are inherently unstable
	organizations that as long as everyone trusts are safe but as soon as some people start
	to panic a cascade of issues quickly arises. I do wish that there was a mention about
	the history of banks and the fact that they were not always risky organizations but the
	speakers did mention that banks are only risky because they attempt to make a profit
	while holding a customers funds, which I found quite nice to hear.

<h3 id="summary-and-comment-5">Summary and Comment</h3>
<p>
	This episode covers the ongoing protests regarding Puerto Rico’s beaches and how the
	dividing line that separates public beaches from private property should be drawn. The
	hosts discuss how the two major ways of defining a public beach in Puerto Rico clash and
	how the law that those definitions stem from is originally from a different part of the
	world (Spain). The contrasting definitions are: 1. The area between the high and low
	tide is a public beach, and 2. The furthest waves reach in a storm is a public beach.

<h3 id="feedback-5">Feedback</h3>
<p>
	This episode does a great job of showing how a group of protesters can through a
	unifying cause and large amounts of dedication make a major difference even against very
	wealthy individuals or governments. Also I have to mention that it seems like the
	speakers are fluent in Spanish and appear to be well versed with Puerto Rican culture.
	It was commendable to see a podcast episode take a large amount of care in depicting the
	people that they are speaking about. I hope that stories like this can inspire people to
	take political action in there own communities and help to build a better world.
