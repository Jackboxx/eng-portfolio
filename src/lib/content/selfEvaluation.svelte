<p>
	I think that much like last year my English hasn’t changed all too much, I’ve gotten
	better at avoiding small grammar or spelling mistakes but I am still not much better at
	grammar and tenses. This is mainly because I haven’t had the time and nor the interest
	in improving beyond average in these area but in the future there might be a point at
	which I find it necessary to do so. In terms of improving my business English
	specifically I think the most effective way to achieve this will be to work/be in a
	business environment or any other place where business related phrases and jargon is
	used. Exposure therapy so to say. All in all I don’t believe I have any particular
	problem areas that stick out but compared to my speech abilities some areas (like
	grammar) are sub par. The main issue is that it seems like I’ve plateaued in terms of my
	ability to use the English language and the only way to improve would be targeted
	practice.
