<p>
	It seems that job satisfaction can be split up into different types of satisfaction
	based on perception: in this case there is cognitive, affective/emotional, and
	behavioral parts. Job satisfaction can also be evaluated on a global level (does an
	employee enjoy their job) and a local level (does an employee enjoy a specific part of
	their job). &gt;&gt; 1. “Job satisfaction can be measured in cognitive (evaluative),
	affective (or emotional), and behavioral components.” Also, when looking for surveys on
	employee satisfaction instead of results I mainly found surveys that managers could give
	to their employees instead of studies. I am curious to see how/if the things employees
	want are different than what managers say they want. At the moment I am concerned that
	modern advice on how to increase employee job satisfaction is being prioritized over
	actions that a business could take to directly increase the material well being over
	their employees (i.e. Raising wages). If my believe will hold up to further research
	remains to be seen.

<h3 id="deeper-theory">2. Deeper Theory</h3>
<p>
	Research into job satisfaction began in the 1930s and mainly focused on the nature of
	the job being worked and the relation ship with coworkers and supervisors. &gt;&gt; 2.
	“The assessment of job satisfaction through employee anonymous surveys became
	commonplace in the 1930s. Although prior to that time there was the beginning of
	interest in employee attitudes, there were only a handful of studies published.” In the
	following decades several models of job satisfaction emerged.
</p>
<h4 id="affect-theory">Affect Theory:</h4>
<p>
	This theory/model focuses on the dissonance with what a person has in there job and what
	they want from their job. In addition, how much a person values something determines how
	much they are effected when their job meats/doesn’t meats this value/expectation.
</p>
<h4 id="equity-theory">Equity Theory:</h4>
<p>
	This theory focuses on how a person perceives fairness in a company. In this theory a
	person evaluates the personal output (the effort put into the company) versus the input
	(the things gained from the company). A person also measures their output against the
	output other people are investing for a particular input to determine if the
	output-input ration is fair. There are other models that have been develop but these
	were the most interesting to me. One thing that is interesting to note is that the
	theories are not just applicable to job satisfaction but to general human behavior. In
	the next entry I’ll be looking through some surveys and studies to see how these
	theories match up with data.

<h3 id="research-and-data">3. Research and Data</h3>
<p>
	According to the research papers I have read so far salary seems to be the least
	significant. &gt;&gt; 3. “The results show that worst assessed facet was (1) salary and
	security…”. On the other hand factors like leadership and nature of the job were more
	important[2] in increasing the enjoyment an employee got out of their work. In addition,
	the type of work (permanent or contingent employment) seem to have a measurable effect
	on job satisfaction[1]. However, it needs to be mentioned that some contingent workers
	have similar job satisfaction as permanent workers. I am interested to see if this might
	be related to the type of clients these contingent workers interact with.

<h3 id="investigating-contingent-work">4. Investigating contingent work</h3>
<p>
	The literature strongly indicates that only temporary agency workers in the contingent
	worker landscape have significantly lower job satisfaction than there permanently
	employed peers. This dissatisfaction seems to largely be due to a lack of satisfaction
	with the content of their jobs. &gt;&gt; 2. “Decomposition of this gap indicates that
	the major part is due to the low satisfaction experienced by agency workers regarding
	the content of their jobs.” In addition, a lower job security and lower average salary
	also slightly contribute to this lower satisfaction. Many modern companies that employ
	contingent workers often due so to outsource menial tasks that they don’t want to deal
	with themselves which results in contingent jobs that are not satisfying to the workers
	doing them. This leads me to believe that there might be a decrease in job satisfaction
	in more than just the contingent sector but this requires further research.

<h3 id="job-satisfaction-trends">5. Job Satisfaction Trends</h3>
<p>
	As expected the general trend of job satisfaction (in the UK and Germany) is a downward
	trend [2]. This appears to be caused by an increase in the intensity of work given to
	workers and the reduction of autonomy in the work place. Adding to this effect is the
	fact that fewer people are working their desired amount of hours in a job. This effect
	isn’t only national it also effects individual businesses, as the job satisfaction
	inside a variety of business has decreased over the years. *It is work noting that the
	study on national trends (2) was published in 2005 so it is possible that trends have
	changed since then but the fact that article 1 sees a similar trend present in 2017
	makes this unlikely.

<h2 id="report">Report</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>
	This report seeks to outline and summarize the findings that we have made regarding “Job
	Satisfaction”.
</p>
<h3 id="influential-factors">Influential Factors</h3>
<p>
	The leading literature suggests that the most important factors in increasing job
	satisfaction are the content of the job being worked and the quality of leadership.
	Salary on the was a less significant factor.
</p>
<h3 id="permanent-vs-contingent-work">Permanent vs Contingent Work</h3>
<p>
	Research only found a small difference between these two types of work. This difference
	only applied to temporary agency workers and is attributed to the unsatisfying nature of
	these jobs. In addition, due to the decreased job security that contingent work provides
	there were slight deltas between job satisfaction when comparing permanent and
	contingent work.
</p>
<h3 id="general-trends">General Trends</h3>
<p>
	Over the last 30 years job satisfaction seems to have decreased both on a national level
	and on a company level.
</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>
	New trends like an increase in contingent work don’t seem to have massively decreased
	job satisfaction but a decrease in happiness with the nature of a job has reduced the
	levels of satisfaction across the labor market.
