	Space, the final frontier... <br />
	Maybe I should have saved this for the last portfolio, you know since it isn't very final
	now... <br />
	Well it can't be helped here is my space travel ready portfolio. I hope you like the direction
	I took the styling, if not there's also a version without all the fancy/retro effects, that
	one is probably more useful for actual reading. But I do encourage you to at least see all
	the effects once (fair warning though I didn't have all to much time so the variety, sorry).
	<br />
	Alright then, have fun! <br />
	... <br />
	Oh yeah wait, this was supposed to be business English related... <br />
	<br />
	Dear Everyone, <br />
	welcome on board this luxury ride into this years annual portfolio presentation. Field with
	high quality business related words and phrases, talks of financial rises and crashes, and
	plenty of business related jargon.
	<br />
	We hope you will have a wonderful time.
