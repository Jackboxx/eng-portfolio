	Space, the final frontier… <br />
	Maybe I should have saved this for the last portfolio, you know since it isn’t very final
	now… <br />
	Well it can’t be helped here is my space travel ready portfolio. <br />
	… Oh yeah wait, this was supposed to be business English related… <br />
	Dear Everyone, welcome on board this luxury ride into this years annual portfolio presentation.
	Field with high quality business related words and phrases, talks of financial rises and
	crashes (mostly in movies), and plenty of business related jargon. <br />
	We hope you will have a wonderful time.
